I am a graduate student passionate about the intersection of Mathematics, Computer Science, and Machine Learning. Driven by curiosity, I aim to pursue a career in fundamental
research, leveraging rigorous theoretical insights to solve complex, real-world problems.

## Current Focus: Theory & Computation

My academic year is structured around two key areas of expertise:

- At [Mines Paris - PSL](https://www.minesparis.psl.eu), my focus is currently shifting toward foundational Computer Science, including compilers, low-level programming, and functional programming (Haskell).
- At the [MVA program](https://www.master-mva.com), I am deepening my skills in Applied Mathematics and particularly Machine Learning. My first semester courses include
  Advanced Learning for Text and Graph Data, Geometric Data Analysis, Optimal Transport, Robotics, Computational Statistics, and Convex Optimization.

## Research and Hands-On Experience

My commitment to the field is rooted in prior research and applied experience:

- I have conducted research at Inria (with the [OCKHAM](https://team.inria.fr/ockham/fr/) and [GENESIS](https://bguedj.github.io) teams) on PAC-Bayes generalization bounds and the role of symmetries in neural networks.
- This theoretical drive is continuously strengthened by hands-on experience, notably through applied research in industrial anomaly detection at Scortex and my work at Harvard, which solidified my passion for both abstract ideas and their tangible impact.

I believe in building and exploring. I invite you to check out the [Projects section](/projects) to see what I've been working on, from research prototypes to personal initiatives. If you are working on interesting problems in ML, Mathematics, or Technology, I would love to connect and exchange ideas!
